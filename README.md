# Scala Bricks
Scala Bricks is an intentionally small library of small building blocks to help build platform independent Scala projects with SBT.

Please note that this is all __WORK IN PROCESS__, so is not yet ready for production use, as evident by the lack of documentaion, credits, attributions and so on.
